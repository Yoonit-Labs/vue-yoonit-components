## Installation

```javascript
npm i -s @yoonit/vue-components
```

## Usage

#### VueJS Plugin

To use the components, import the library into your project's main.js file.

`main.js`
```javascript
import Vue from 'vue'
import YoonitVueComponents from '@yoonit/vue-components'

Vue.use(YoonitVueComponents)
```

After that, you can access each component by calling it in the html template.

#### YooButton Component Example
`App.vue`
```vue
<template>
  <yoo-button
    variation="base"
    buttonSize="normal"
    fill="primary"
    animation="none"
    text="Button Base"
  />
  
  <yoo-button
    variation="outline"
    buttonSize="normal"
    fill="primary"
    animation="none"
    text="Button Outline"
  />
  
  <yoo-button
    variation="base"
    buttonSize="normal"
    fill="danger"
    icon="check"
    iconPosition="left"
    iconSize="normal"
    iconStyle="solid"
    animation="none"
    text="Button danger + icon check"
  />
</template>
